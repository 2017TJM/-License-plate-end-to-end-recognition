# -License-plate-end-to-end-recognition
Convolutional neural network is used for end-to-end recognition, input the whole license plate and the corresponding label for training; during the test, input the image including the license plate, and output the corresponding license plate label. It can realize license plate recognition based on convolution neural network, and can realize license plate recognition without character segmentation.
